# Time-Frames-a-concise-sytax-for-specifying-time-date-search-parameters

I was clearing papers recently and I came across a paper I developed in the mid 1980s concerning the design of a method and syntax that could be used to specify time/date search parameters for searching chronologically structured databases.  That is a file system that stored a database as a linear time ordered file, such that record Rn would occur physically before a record Rn+1 for all n > 0.  Data stored on a magnetic tape is a perfect example of such a file system.  The method/syntax is referred to as “Time Frames”.
Today, of course, relational databases render such methods largely superfluous offering sophisticated indexing and search technologies.  However, in the 1970/80s such technologies where not that well established (or affordable), but magnetic tape was cheap and offered a reliable medium for data storage.  Programmers in these times had to be more inventive that perhaps they need to be today with such powerful tools at their disposal.
The attached two part paper describes the method of Time Frames and its syntax.  My purpose for including this on github is two fold:
1.	To store it for posterity, and
2.	To expose it to a wider audience, just in case someone finds it useful.
The paper is split in two parts – pages 1-4 and pages 5-8.  This simply to get around the github 25 Mb file limit.  I hope someone finds it of interest.
